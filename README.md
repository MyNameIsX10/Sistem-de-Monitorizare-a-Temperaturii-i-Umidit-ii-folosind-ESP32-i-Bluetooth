# Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System using ESP32 and Bluetooth

## Description

This project implements a temperature and humidity monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT11 sensor. The project uses Bluetooth technology to transmit the collected data to a mobile device, allowing users to access real-time information. This system is ideal for environmental monitoring applications, such as greenhouses, offices, or homes.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Collects and transmits temperature and humidity data via Bluetooth.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Users can access the data from a mobile device through a Bluetooth app, simplifying the monitoring process.

- **DHT11 Sensor:** Uses a DHT11 sensor for accurate temperature and humidity measurements.

## Technologies Used

- **ESP32:** A microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, used to create the monitoring system and transmit data.

- **DHT11 Sensor:** A temperature and humidity sensor that provides precise environmental data.

- **Bluetooth:** A communication protocol used to transmit data to mobile devices.
